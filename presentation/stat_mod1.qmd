## VAR Model

Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are popular choice for studying the joint
dynamics of multiple time series.  

Consider $x_t$ as a $p$-dimensional vector of time-series at time $t$, a VAR 
model is just a multivariate normal regression of $x_t$ on its own-lags
$$ x_t = c + \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \Pi_i x_{t-i} + \epsilon_t \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (1)$$

where $\Pi_i$ are $p \times p$ coefficient matrices determining the dynamics of 
the system, $c$ is a deterministic vector of $p$ components and 
$\epsilon_t \sim N_p(0,\Sigma)$. 


## Example of VAR(1)

A first order VAR model ($p = 1$) in two variables would be given by
$$\begin{pmatrix} x_{1,t}\\x_{2,t} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c_1\\c_2 \end{pmatrix} +  \begin{pmatrix} \pi_{11} & \pi_{12} \\ \pi_{21} & \pi_{22} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_{1,t}\\x_{2,t} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \epsilon_{1,t}\\\epsilon_{2,t} \end{pmatrix}$$  

If, for example $\pi_{12} \neq 0$, this means that the history of $x_2$ helps 
explaining $x_1$.  


## Pros & Cons

- Main advantage: simplicity. VAR models require no special structure since the 
outcome variables are regressed on their own lagged variables.  
  
- Main disadvantage: large number of regression coefficients, $K(Kp + m)$. The 
significant number of regression parameters is proportional to the number of 
lags, hence interpretation may be difficult and may not be good when fitted to 
small data.   
  
Several tools have been proposed to aid in the interpretation of VAR models, 
most notably Impulse Response Functions (IRF) and Granger Causality tests (GC).  


## Granger Causality

The general idea behind Granger causality is that a variable $X$ 
Granger causes $Y$ if past values of $X$ can help explain $Y$.  

Of course, if Granger causality holds this does not guarantee that $X$ causes $Y$. 
Nevertheless, if past values of $X$ have explanatory power for current values of 
$Y$, it at least suggests that $X$ improves $Y$’s predictability.   

In the context of a VAR model, testing for Granger causality simply implies to 
test the significance of the cross-coefficients ($\pi_{12}$ and $\pi_{21}$ in 
the VAR(1) example).



# 2. Graphical VARs

## Graphical Model

Graphical models can be informally defined as statistical models represented in 
the form of a graph, where the nodes (vertices) represents the variables and the
presence of an edge between a pair of vertices means that the variables are in 
some sense related.

Some advantages of a graphical model are:  

- represents graphically the logical implication of the relationships  
- suitable representation of the causal relationships using directed edges   
- clarity of interpretation when analyzing complex interactions.  


## DAG Model

In cross-sectional data, the graph usually represents the conditional independence 
structure of the system and (by symmetry) the edges are undirected. In time-series 
data, the time dimension of a process makes it more feasible to consider directed 
flow.  

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a collection $G = \{V,E\}$, where $V$ is the
set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.

## Connecting DAG and VAR

Given the VAR model in (1), there is a one-to-one relationship between the 
$\Pi_i$ matrices and DAGs, that is
$$x_{a,t-i} \rightarrow x_{b,t} \iff \Pi_i(a,b) \neq 0$$  

Where $x_{a,t-i} \rightarrow x_{b,t}$ means that $x_{a,t-i}$ "causes" somehow $x_{b,t}$

Hence, directed edges represent exactly the Granger causality relations.


## Graphical VAR Model (Lemma 1)







A Gaussian VAR process  satisfying Lemma 1 is said to belong to a graphical 
Granger causal VAR model, VAR(G, k).
