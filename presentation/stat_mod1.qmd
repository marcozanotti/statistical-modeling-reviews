# 1. VARs

## Problem

To predict **timely and accurately** the election results  
\   
**Strategical task** in the political area since political forces spend millions of 
dollars in each candidate's campaign and need to know when and where to allocate 
them  
\    
The **US**: presidential election is the result of the voting process in each state  


# 2. Graphical VARs

## Type of Data

Forecasting elections makes use of mainly two different types data:    

- **Fundamental indicators**, that is economic or political variables  
\  
- **Trial-heat polls**, that is surveys with trail-heat questions issued by 
oﬀicial pollsters’ agency  


# 3. Bayesian Model Assessment for Graphical VARs

## Type of Models

Over the years, three types of election forecasting models evolved:  

- **Structural models**, econometric models based on fundamental indicators  
  
- **Trial-heat models**, econometric models relying on polls data  

- **Bayesian models**, models that use polls data to update historical forecasts, 
improving the performance of structural models through the incorporation of 
voters preferences’ evolution  

The variable of interest is usually the percentage election outcome of one of 
the two major parties ($\pi_t$)  


# 4. Conclusions

## Conclusions

- A Bayesian approach produces **continuously revised forecasts** as new poll 
data is released  

- Forecasting using **both** structural variables and poll data outperform others  

- In general, forecasts are accurate **within 2 months** before the election day  

- It is **still difficult** to produce timely and accurate forecasts  

- **Problems** arise in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty for states that are 
polled few and in those days with no polls at all
