## Summary

The paper focuses on the impact of different exchange rate regimes on economic 
growth and employs a variety of non-parametric matching methods to address 
potential biases in previous research. For this purpose a comprehensive dataset 
covering 164 countries from 1970 to 2007, considering the period after the 
collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, and many control 
variables.
Whereas previous studies used mainly linear regression models, likely 
introducing self-selection bias and other issues, the authors adopted matching 
techniques to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of exchange rate 
regimes on economic growth, aiming to address self-selection bias.  
In this study, propensity score is employed to estimate the effect of exchange 
rate regimes on economic growth. This approach involves creating a probability 
score for each country to determine the likelihood of choosing a floating or 
fixed exchange rate regime based on observable covariates. Moreover, various 
matching methods, including nearest-neighbor matching, radius matching, kernel 
matching, and local linear matching, are tested to find suitable matches between 
countries with different exchange rate regimes.  
The results of all matching methods consistently indicate that the average 
treatment effect of floating exchange rate regimes on economic growth is 
statistically insignificant. In other words, the study finds no evidence to 
suggest that adopting a floating exchange rate regime leads to higher economic 
growth compared to a fixed exchange rate regime.  



## Advantages and Limitations

The authors used an innovative methodology for the research area since by using 
propensity score and a variety of matching techniques, they addressed potential 
biases that may have affected previous researches. Moreover, the use of a 
comprehensive dataset covering 164 countries over a substantial time period 
provides a robust foundation for the analysis and the inclusion of various 
control variables helps control for potential confounding factors.  
Through a common support analysis, the research ensures that there is good 
overlap between the control group (fixed exchange rate regime) and the treatment 
group (floating exchange rate regime). This common support ensures that observed 
characteristics of treatment group countries can also be found among control 
group countries.  
The SUTVA assumptions is satisfied by the pre and post Bretton Woods regimes.  
Finally, The paper reports consistent results across different matching methods and 
conducts also a robustness analysis using Rosenbaum's bounds to assess the 
influence of hidden biases. This approach adds credibility to the findings 
and strengthens the conclusion that exchange rate regimes do not significantly 
affect economic growth.  

On the limitation side, instead, the paper relies on the assumption of common 
support between control and treatment groups. While this is a crucial assumption
in propensity score matching, the paper should provide some check analysis to
explore the sensitivity of results to variations in this assumption.  
Moreover, the authors are dealing with a panel dataset, hence the classic matching
methods used may not be very appropriate since they lack to consider the time 
dimension. For instance, one may refine the matching first selecting a set of 
control observations from other units in the same time period that have an 
identical treatment history for a specified time span so that matched control 
observations become similar to the treated observation in terms of covariate
history. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the authors used a multilevel model
to estimate the propensity score. This kind of approach could improve significantly
the estimation since it considers also the time variability of the covariates.
Finally, the paper concludes that there is no significant impact of exchange rate 
regimes on economic growth. However, it's essential to recognize that the 
findings may not apply universally across all time periods, countries, or 
economic contexts. Some discussion of the potential limitations of generalizing 
these findings could enhance the paper's completeness.  
    


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the paper introduces an innovative methodology and uses a 
comprehensive dataset to examine the impact of exchange rate regimes on 
economic growth. Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the 
empirical literature on exchange rate regimes and economic growth but should 
be interpreted within the context of its limitations.
